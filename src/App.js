The app also included a web scraper using cheerio. My responsibilities were everything except for the web scraper, and some of the front-end design.

                              I created this site early in the Case Western program to practice JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3. The site was a request from a colleague planning to open a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu bussiness.
